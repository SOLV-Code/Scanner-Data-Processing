The Nov 8 survey was removed from the calculation as a result of high flows and poor counting conditions.  An adjustment was made to the aerial surveys spawner counts as per the 2014 Nahatlatch adjustment.  Two surveys were conducted on the spawning channel but no fish were observed; the channel had silted over.

Severe forest burns in the upper watershed have contributed to high water as trees and organics no long retain or evapotranspire water. Overland and we assume aquifer flows are uninhibited by normal water retention and removal processes in the Bonaparte watershed.  An attempt was made by the Bonaparte Band to run a collection fence for capturing and moving fish above the fishway but it failed due to high water. One Coho adult was moved above the fishway.

May have been another push, can't say for sure as DIDSON was out of the water. Image quality of files was good to moderate with shadows/grainy appearance. Very early freshet and very low flows during late spring and summer. May affect fry survival."

A fence was installed on Sep 11 by NTA. A DIDSON sonar operated briefly on Oct 3 and was pulled on Oct 4 due to a malfunction. The fence was lowered on Nov 2 due to a high water event and raised on Nov 4. Fish were counted through visually during this period. The sonar was reinstalled on Nov 6. Ice build up on Nov 18-21 and panels were lowered. Program ended on Nov 21. The fence was lowered and oberver counts were also conducted on Oct 24-26 and Oct 28-29.   This was a very successful program this year as the fence was maintained throughout the program. 182 ad clip Coho were removed at the fence for PIN status. 67 fish were removed at the fence for brood and 121 were removed upstream by SEP for brood and removed from the spawner total derived from the fence (4404-121=4283).

The fence, trap box and sonar were lost downstream on Nov 14 due to a major flood event. An ARIS sonar unit was operational on Sep 26 but mostly ran as backup to the fence until mid-Oct. The Final estimate (N=11473) includes the sonar count of 10,920, plus the 386 fish sampled and passed u/s through the trap, plus the 375 visual count. The estimate does not include: DOA= 1 or the 208 removed for brood:  M=103 ; F=105. Of the brood removed 55 were taken at the fence and 153 were captured by SEP. The estimate also does not include 221 CWT sacrifices at the fence. "

Deadman counter was not operational in 2017 due to equipment damage from summer fires.  Skeetchestn ran the brood collection fence nearly the full season according to an email from Aaron Gillespie (SFC).  It was noted that 80 Coho were counted u/s of the fence prior to it being fish tight on Sep 28.  The fence was pulled on Nov 3 due to ice and panels were put back in on Nov 8.  Fish (n=80) observed holding below the fence before it was pulled.  Peak migration occurred btw Oct 17 and 21 (n=355); smaller pulse occurred btw Nov 13 and 15 (n=83).  The fence was taken out for the season on Nov 20 and 44 Coho were observed holding below.  Brood Taken: 46 M ; 56 F.  Harvest: 27 M ; 26 F.  Escapement Sex Ratio:  M=43% ; F=57%.

There were several periods of missing data: 1. Video validation data were not available from Sep 3 to Sep 11 or from Oct 11 to Oct 16, 2. Graphics data were not collected from Sep 11 to Sep 16., 3. Complete counter outage occurred from Sep 16 to Sep 18.  These outages resulted in limited data available btw Sep 3 and Sep 11 and no usable counter data btw Sep 11 and Sep 18.  The Coho escapement estimate from Sep 16 to Nov 25 was 2399. Confidence in these estimates is moderate due to missing data throughout Sep and a shadow and periphyton buildup on Channel 2 resulting in challenging validation conditions.  Estimate was provided by Instream.  No brood or harvest was reported by SFC.   "

Video data were recorded and used to validate the counter. Due to extremely low water levels through the operational period only counter 2 channel was wetted and operational for most of the run. Counter data were randomly validated using video data from Sep 16-Oct 4 with additional validation completed on Oct 17. A total of 57 hrs of video was viewed (3% of total video available). Graphics data were inconsistenly recorded due to technical problems; the time period of the missing data was not provided, however, most of the missing graphics data occurred on Oct 17 the peak day of migration.
